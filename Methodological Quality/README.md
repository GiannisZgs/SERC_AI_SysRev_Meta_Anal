# Methodological Quality

Contains the methodological quality analysis of the systematic review studies; based on this analysis' results and the risk of bias evaluation, we evaluate the suitability of the studies to be included in the meta-analysis. A Pareto analysis is implemented, were each study is screened against 9 quality criteria. A score is assigned for each criterion, and a Pareto chart is drawn based on the total score. A cutoff threshold is determined based on the average to cumulative score ratio, and studies below that threshold are deemed of insufficient methodological quality. Specifically, the following files are contained:

- **_pareto_analysis.xlsx_**: contains the detailed scoring instructions and outcomes for studies, which are then used to generate the chart.
- **_Pareto_chart.jpg_**: contains the resulting Pareto chart (Fig.4 in the paper).
