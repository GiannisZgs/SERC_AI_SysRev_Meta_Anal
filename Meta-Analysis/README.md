# Meta-Analysis

This directory contains tools and results for performing the meta-analysis. We utilized the 1.5 version of the _Meta-Essentials_ workbooks [1], that contains necessary tools to measure diagnostic test performance and assess heterogeneity of the studies. Specifically, the following files are contained:

- **_diagnostic_test_performance_data_extraction.xlsx_**: Contains the extracted data (performance metrics) from the used papers (Note: unfortunately some data were lost and this file lacks information from some papers).
- **_meta_essentials_sheets_**: 
- **__**:
