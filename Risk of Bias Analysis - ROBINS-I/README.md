# Risk of Bias Analysis - ROBINS-I

Contains tools and results of the risk of bias analysis through the ROBINS-I tool (Risk of Bias In Non-randomised Studies- of Interventions) [1]. 

- **Directory _per_paper_assessment_tool_**: contains .docx files for each paper of the systematic review. Each paper is screened and decisions regarding domains of bias are taken, leading to a final overall bias judgment for each paper.

- **_Robins_chart.xlsx_**: unifies the decisions from the assessment tools into an overall diagram where studies are ranked according to their overall bias. Bias in specific domains is also demonstrated, individually for each study and collectively for the review.

- **_Robins-I_chart.jpg_**: the resulting diagram (Fig.5 in the paper).
